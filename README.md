With Vue Js Login, you can have a simple but elegant login structure.


In this application, firebase authentication and input control structure with vuelidate are used.

In addition, the "Users Signed In, Users Signed Up, Uptime" data at the bottom are also real data. Node.js & Express.js as backend and MongoDB as database.

The numbers of users who have logged in and become new members are recorded in the database. In the next version, it is planned to change the numbers instantly when a new user logs in or new registration with Socket.io. Now, when the page is rendered, the numbers are counted up with Vue Js Counter.

## Node.js - Backend 
If you want the count up area at the bottom to be active in the project, you must also install the Node.js part of this project.
Also, you have to use MangoDb. You can find the details of the project on the project's own page.
